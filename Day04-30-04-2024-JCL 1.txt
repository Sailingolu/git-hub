-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

01.	SORT utility
	------------

	- SORT is all about arranging data in ascending / descending order.

	- SORT process

	  Analogy :-	Basket (Fruits)		      ---> Juice Maker (Prepare Juice)            ---> Glass (Juice)
	  Sort process	Input file (unsorted records) ---> Temporary file (sort unsorted records) ---> Output file (sorted records)

		- First, unsorted records will be copied from input file to tempoary file.
		- Second, unsorted records will be sorted in temporary file
		- Third, sorted records will be copied from the temporary file to the output file.

	- SORT utility DD names

		a. SYSOUT	: //SYSOUT DD SYSOUT=*
				  - SYSOUT is similar to SYSPRINT of IEBGENER
				  - SYSOUT DD name is coded to specify the device on which SORT UTILITY messages will be displayed.
				  - In the above example, the SORT utility messages will be displayed in the spool (SYSOUT=*).

		b. SORTIN	: //SORTIN DD DSN=input-dataset-name,DISP=OLD
				  - SORTIN DD name is coded to specify the input dataset name which contains unsorted records.

		c. SORTWK01	: //SORTWK01 DD UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(1,1))
				  - SORTWK01 DD name is coded to specify temporary dataset in which sorting will take place.						  - Temporay file is also called as a work file.

		d. SORTOUT	: //SORTOUT DD DSN=output-dataset-name,DISP=OLD
				  - SORTOUT DD name is coded to specify output dataset name which will contain sorted records.

		e. SYSIN	: //SYSIN  DD *
		 		   SORT FIELDS=(start-pos,length,data-type,sort-sequence)
				  /*
				
				  - SYSIN DD name is coded to specify the "sort card".
				  - "Sort card" will contain input related to starting position of field to be sorted, length
				    of the field to be sorted, data type of the field, sort sequence of the field (A/D).

03.	SORT CARD commands

	a.	INCLUDE command - this will filter the records of input file while sorting.

		Syntax :- INCLUDE COND=(start-pos,length,data-type,operator,C'value')
				
			- start-pos : is the starting position of the field on which you want to specify the filter condition.
			- length    : is the length of the field on which you want to specify the filter condition.
			- data-type : data type of the filter field
			- operator  : EQ, NE, LE, LT, GE, GT
			- C'value'  : data to be checked in the filter condition

	b.	OMIT command - this will exclude the records satisfying the filter condition while sorting.

		Syntax :- OMIT COND=(start-pos,length,data-type,operator,C'value')
				
			- start-pos : is the starting position of the field on which you want to specify the filter condition.
			- length    : is the length of the field on which you want to specify the filter condition.
			- data-type : data type of the filter field
			- operator  : EQ, NE, LE, LT, GE, GT
			- C'value'  : data to be checked in the filter condition

	c. 	OUTREC command - this can be used to reformat your output.
