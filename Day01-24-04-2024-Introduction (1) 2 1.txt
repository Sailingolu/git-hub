01. 	What is a Mainframe ?
    	- Mainframe is hardware.
    	- Mainframe is used to process large sets of data (millions of records).
	- Mainframe processes the data at a very high speed.
	- Mainframe hardware cost is high.
	- Mainframe occupies lot of floor space.
	- Mainframe hardware requires dust-free environment
	- Mainframe is a legacy system. Though it is a legacy system, it is used by most of the top clients today.
	- Mainframe technology is stable. Code written 60 years back are still being used today.

02.	Hardware ranges
	- Microcomputers - occupies tablespace. Process thousands of records
	- Minicomputers  - Process lakhs of records.
	- Mainframes     - Process millions of records
	- Supercomputers - Process records related to time-critical applications (space, traffic control, weather forcasting)

03.	Mainframe modules
	- TSO/ISPF - TSO - Time Sharing options. ISPF - Interactive System Productivity Facility.
		   - TSO/ISPF contains a set of commands used to perform various tasks on Mainframes.
		   - You can perform basic operations - create a file, enter data in file, copy file, rename file, delete file, etc.
		   - TSO : You have to type the command along with options to perform the basic operation.
		   - ISPF : is menu-driven. You need to select the option to perform the basic operation.

	- JCL	   - JCL - Job Control Language
		   - On Mainframes, we cannot compile, link, execute any program directly on mainframes. 
		   - We need to have JCL code which will compile, link, execute programs.
		   - Programs are compiled, linked, executed via JCL code.

	- VSAM	   - VSAM - Virtual Storage Access Method
		   - VSAM is all about file management.
		   - We have 4 types of VSAM files using which we can write programs to write a record, read a record, 
		     update a record, delete a record in/from VSAM files.

	- COBOL	   - COBOL - COmmon Business Oriented Language
		   - COBOL is a high level language used to develop commercial applications in Mainframes.
		   - Commerical applications : banking, insurance, finance, retail, ecommerce

	- DB2	   - DB2 - Data Base 2
		   - DB2 is a Relational Data Base Management System. 
		   - DB2 is a database. We can create tables, insert rows, update rows, delete rows, select rows, etc.

	- CICS	   - CICS - Customer Information Control Systems
		   - CICS is one of the front end software for Mainframes.

		   
04.	Operating Systems	
	- Early 60's - OS - Operating System 
	- Late  60's - OS/MFT and OS/MVT where MFT - Multiple Fixed Tasks and MVT - Multiple Variable Tasks
	- Early 70's - MVS - Multiple Virtual Storage
	- Mid 90     - OS/390
	- 2000	     - z/OS

05.	Features of Mainframe Operating System

	1. Multiprogramming - is the ability of the OS to execute more than one programs at the same time.

	2. Virtual Storage  - is the hard disk space in which programs are stored temporarily when they are not required in the
   	   memory. If you have many programs loaded in memory and if you want to execute program-A. Now, space may not be there
	   for program-A in memory. OS will then shift one of the idle programs (X) of memory to Virtual Storage and then load 
	   program-A in memory. If the idle program (X) need to be executed, OS will first shift one of the idle programs (Y) of memory
	   to virtual storage and then shift the idle program of virtual storage (X) from virtual storage back to memory and 
	   execute it.

		> idle program in memory -> OS will shift the program from memory to virtual storage
		> idle program in virtual storage wanting to execute -> OS will shift the program from virtual storage to memory		
	3. Spooling - is related to printing. Using spooling, OS will first copy the image of the data to be printed in a spool file
           and then another OS program will print the data from the spool file to printer. Spooling reduces program execution time.
	   Without spooling, a program will take more time to execute.

	4. Batch processing - is implemented on huge sets of records. Batch processing programs are executed in a non-interactive 
	   manner. They take lot of time to execute. Non-interactive programs do not require user intevention when they execute.
	   Copying data, backup data, restore data, sort data, print data are some examples of non-interactive programs.

	5. Time Sharing - is implemented for front end applications. We have more than one users using the application at the same
   	   time. Using timsharing, OS will dedicate specific time to each user to process the request and keep on toggling between
	   the other users once the time interval is completed. This entire process is so fast that each user gets a feel as if
	   the server is interacting only with him/her.

06.	Basic Terms 

	1. Dataset - A dataset is a file. In Mainframe environment, a file is called as a dataset. It can contain records (data).

	2. Partitioned Data Set (PDS) - A PDS can contain one or more members where each member can contains program source code
	   or object code or executable code. One PDS can contain only one or more members, it cannot contain another PDS or a
	   dataset in it.

	3. Member - A member is always part of a PDS. It can contain program source code, object code, executable code.

		Q. What is the difference between a dataset and a member ?
		A. 1. A dataset is not associated with a PDS. A member is always assocaited with a PDS.
		   2. A dataset contains records (data). A member contains program source code, object code, executable code.

	4. VTOC - VTOC stands for Volume Table Of Contents. When you create a new file, OS will make entry of newly created file 
	   in VTOC along with its attributes (file name, user, file size, location, creation date...). When you want to open the
	   file at a later point in time, OS will first check the file and its location from VTOC and then open the file.

	5. DASD - Direct Access Storage Device. DASD term is used to refer to hard disk.

	6. Naming Conventions
			  
		a. Dataset 
		    - A dataset name can have 1 to 5 qualifiers in the name where each qualifier can contain 1 to 8 characters.
		    - Syntax : Q1.Q2.Q3.Q4.Q5	 
		    - Examples :
			- OZAGS3.WIPRO.DATA
			- OZAGS3.EMPLOYEE.SAMPLE.DATA
		    - A dataset name can contain maximum 44 characters
		    - Each qualifier must begin with an alphabet or a national character (@ # $) and followed by an alphabets,
		      national characters or a digits. Qualifier name must not begin with a digit.
				- OZAGS3.STUDENT.$2024.RESULT
				- OZAGS3.WIPRO.JCL@PGM

		b. Partitioned Dataset (PDS)
		    - A PDS name can have 1 to 4 qualifiers in the name where each qualifier can contain 1 to 8 characters.
		    - Syntax : Q1.Q2.Q3.Q4	 
		    - Examples :
			- OZAGS3.WIPRO.DATA
			- OZAGS3.EMPLOYEE.SAMPLE.DATA
		    - A PDS name can contain maximum 35 characters
		    - Each qualifier must begin with an alphabet or a national character (@ # $) and followed by an alphabets,
		      national characters or a digits. Qualifier name must not begin with a digit.
				- OZAGS3.STUDENT.$2024.RESULT
				- OZAGS3.WIPRO.JCL@PGM

		c. Member
		    - A member name can have only 1 qualifier in the name where the qualifier can contain 1 to 8 characters.
		    - Syntax : Q1	 
		    - Examples :
			- PGM01
			- COBPGM
		    - A member name can contain maximum 8 characters.
		    - The qualifier must begin with an alphabet or a national character (@ # $) and followed by an alphabets,
		      national characters or a digits. Qualifier name must not begin with a digit.
				- $PGM01
				- PGM#01

	7. Dataset/PDS allocation
		- Allocation means reserving disk space in advance for a dataset/PDS before it is created.

		- At the time of allocation you need to give the following inputs to the OS :-

			- name of dataset/PDS

			- space unit (TRACK/CYLINDER/KB/MB/BYTES)

			- primary extent - space will be immediately given at the time of allocation.

			- secondary extent - space will be given on demand.

			- record length - number of characters you want to type maximum on each line of the file.
			  If record length = 80, it means each of my file can contain maximum 80 characters.

			- record format - this can FB - Fixed Blocked or VB - Variable Blocked

				FB - Fixed Length record
				------------------------
				101 ASHISH---- 45
				102 TIM------- 28
				103 RAHUL----- 31


				VB - Variable Length record
				---------------------------
				101 ASHISH 45
				102 TIM 28
				103 RAHUL 31
			
				Fixed Length record - Each record of the file will begin and end in the same column.

				Variable Length record - Each record of the file will begin in the same column but may end in 
				different columns.

			- Block size - this should be a mutiple of record length. If record length = 80, then block size can be
			  640, 320, 800. Block size parameter is used while copying data from one dataset to another dataset or
			  while performing block operations.

			- Dataset name Type - If you are allocating a dataset, then do not type anything in Dataset Name Type.
			  If you are allocating a PDS, then type Dataset Name Type = PDS.

			- Directory blocks - If you are allocating a dataset, then Directory blocks = 0. If you are allocation
			  a PDS, then directory blocks = n where n is a number.
