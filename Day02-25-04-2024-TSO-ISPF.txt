	Editor Primary Commands
	-----------------------
	01. SAVE  - Save the dataset

	02. UNNUM - Give line numbers as 1,2,3,4,5,.....

	03. UNDO - used to undo recent changes made to text. For this, you must first give RECOVERY ON command before making
	    and changes to the text. RECOVERY ON command will enable the facility of undo. To disable this facility, given RECOVERY
            OFF command.

	04. NUM ON/OFF - NUM ON will display line numbers as 100, 200, 300, ... NUM OFF will display line numbers as 1,2,3, ....
	    NUM ON :- If you edit the text (insert/copy/move), you will see that your line number sequence in not proper. To
	    get the proper sequence, you must give UNNUM command followed by NUM ON command.
	    NUM OFF :- If you edit the text (insert/copy/move), your line numbers will be automatically be realigned. No need to
	    give UNNUM command in this case.

	05. CHANGE ALL 'string1' 'string2' - this will replace all occurences of string1 with string2. If ALL is not coded, then
	    only the first occurence of string1 will be replaced.

	06. RESET - If you have some text on the line number columns, then you can code RESET command to replace the text with
	    the line numbers.

	07. M<F7> / M<F8> : M<F7> will take you to the first line of the file. M<F8> will take you to the last line of the file.

	08. CAPS ON/ OFF : 
	    CAPS ON :- If you type text in Proper case/lower case/upper case, on pressing <enter> the text will get converted to
            upper case
	    CAPS OFF :- If you type text in Proper case/lower case/upper case, on pressing <enter> the text will remain in the
	    same case as what you had typed.



	Exercise

	01. Open USER.PROGRAMS.DATA. Enter 7 new names after the 3rd name.

	02. Change the first occurence of any one name to SURENDRA.

	03. Change the text of 7th line to lower case.

	04. Shift the text of the 4th line to the right by 5 columns.

	05. Type RECOVERY OFF command. Delete any 1 line. Type UNDO command. The undo operation will fail.

	06. Type RECOVERY ON command. Delete 2nd line, 8th line, 9th line. Type UNDO command. Last delete operation will be undone.
	    You can give UNDO command again to get the next most recent deletion back.

	07. Convert the entire text of the file to lower case.

	08. Shift the entire text to the right by 10 columns.

	09. Type NUM OFF command. You will get line numbers as 1,2,3,4,....

	10. Type NUM ON command. You will get line numbers as 100, 200, 300, ....

	11. Copy 4th line after 7th line. Insert a new name after the 2nd name. You will see line numbers are not in proper sequence.

	12. Type UNNUM command. Type NUM ON command. You will get proper sequence.

	13. On 4th line number type C. On 7th line number type M. On 10th line number type A. Press <enter>. You will see C, M, A
	    in RED color. Type RESET command on command line to replace the C, M, A with line numbers.

	14. Copy USER.PROGRAMS.DATA to SCHOOL.ABC.DATA. Check if the dataset has been copied.

	15. Delete SCHOOL.ABC.DATA. Check if the dataset has been deleted.


02.	Allocating a PDS :-

	Differences in allocating a dataset and allocating a PDS in =3.2 comand.
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. If you are allocating a dataset, then Directory Blocks = 0.
	   If you are allocating a PDS, then Directory Blocks = n where n is a number > 0

	2. If you are allocating a dataset, then Dataset Name Type = blank
	   If you are allocating a PDS, then Dataset Name Type = PDS.

	Question : How to differentiate between a dataset and a PDS in =3.4 command ?
	Answer : Type S command on left of dataset/PDS name. Check Organization parameter. 
	         If Organization is PS (Physical Sequential), it means it is a dataset.
	         If Organization is PO (Partioned Organization), it means it is a PDS.
	
	Create a member in PDS
	----------------------
	01. Type E on left of PDS name and type (membername) after the pds name <enter>
	02. You will be in editor. You can type the text. Save. End.
	03. Type E on left of PDS name. You will see your member name. 
	04. Type E on left of member name. You will see the contents of the member.

	Directory Blocks
	----------------
	> Directory blocks for a PDS signifies the total number of members you would like to have in the PDS.

	> The number specified in Directory blocks is derived as follows :-

			Directory Blocks	Total members in PDS
			----------------	--------------------
				1			05
				2			11
				3			17
				4			23
				5			29
				6			35

	  If Directory Blocks limit is exceeded, then you will get an error 'No space in directory' on top right corner of screen.

03. 	Working with multiple screens
	-----------------------------
	1. SWAPBAR - this command will display/hide the screen name on the last line of the screen.

	2. START   - this will start a new screen. If multiple screens are open, then * will be displayed on the current screen name.

	3. SWAP n  - this will switch to screen n. Alternatively, you can use mouse, click on the screen name to activate the screen.

	4. SWAP LIST - this will display a list of all the screens. If you type S on left of a screen name, then that screen will
	   be activated.


04.	Exercise

	01. Using =3.2 command, Allocate a PDS by the name COURSE.PGMS. Directory blocks = 1. Dataset Name type = PDS. 
            Rest of the attributes same as that given for dataset.

	02. Using =3.4, check if the PDS has been allocated. Using S command, check organization if it is PO.

	03. Create a member BE$CS. Enter name of 3 modules of the course.
	04. Create a member BE$EL. Enter name of 3 modules of the course.
	05. Create a member BCA. Enter name of 3 modules of the course.
	06. Create a member BCS. Enter name of 3 modules of the course.
	07. Create a member COLLEGE. Enter name of 4 colleges.

	08. Using =3.4, check if pds is having 5 members.

	09. On command line, type SWAPBAR command. One name will appear on the last line.
	10. Create a new screen by typing START command. You will see two names on the last line.
	11. Using mouse you can toggle between the screens. Also, using SWAP 1/ SWAP 2 commands, you can toggle between the screens.
	12. Create a 3 more new screens using START command.
	13. Open BE$CS member in Screen 1.
	14. Open BE$EL member in Screen 2.
	15. Open BCA member in Screen 3.
	16. Open BCS member in Screen 4.
	17. Open College member in Screen 5.
	18. Toggle between the screens using mouse or SWAP commands and check if you are able to view the contents.

	19. If you want to close any screen, then type =X on the command line of the screen.


05.	Space Unit, Primary Quantity, Secondary Quantity
	------------------------------------------------
	> Scenario : Dataset name : A1.B1, Space Unit = TRKS, Primary Qty : 12, Secondary Qty : 5

		> Each dataset will have 16 extents allocated to it out of which 1 primary extent and 15 secondary extents

		> The number specified in Primary Qty (12), will be assigned to 1 primary extent 
		  Meaning : 1 primary extent = 12 tracks

		> The number specified in Secondary Qty will be assigned to each of the secondary extents (15 times)
		  Meaning : 1 secondary = 5 tracks, 2 secondary extent = 5 tracks, ........ 15 secondary extent = 5 tracks

		> The total space allocated to the dataset will be 12 + (5 x 15) = 87 tracks.

	> When A1.B1 is allocated, 12 tracks (1 extent) will be allocated. As you enter the data, each of 12 tracks will get
	  utilized with the data.

	> Once all 12 tracks are fully utilized, OS will allocate 1st secondary extent of 5 tracks to A1.B1. You can now add more
	  data to the dataset.

	> Once 5 tracks of 1st secondary extent is fully utilized, OS will allocate 2nd secondary extent of 5 tracks to A1.B1.
	  You can now add more data to the dataset.

	> The above process will be repeated by the OS till all 15 secondary extents have been utilized. Once all 15 secondary
	  extents are utilized, and if you enter more data and save the file, you will get an abend 0B37.
	  ABEND means ABnormal END.


06.	Exercise

	01. Delete any 2 members of COURSE.PGMS PDS. Check if the members have been deleted.

	02. Rename any one member to a new member. Check if the member has been renamed.

	03. Copy all the contents of any 1 member to a new member BACKUP. Check if BACKUP is created and also check the contents.

	04. Copy specific lines of any 1 member to a new member BKUP. Check if BKUP is created and also check the contents.
